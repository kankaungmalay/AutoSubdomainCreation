		<p>Normally, if we want to create subdomains under root domain (eg: root domain is example.com, we can create many subdomains: blog.example.com, forum.example.com etc.), firstly we have to log into our cPanel account with respective cPanle UserName and Password.</p>
		<p>After logging in, we can create subdomains, database and database users.</p>
		<p>Here, this script will help us to create subdomains without needing to log into cPanel account.</p>
		<p>Easy, Reduce time consuming .. right?</p>
		<p>You can create subdomians as much as you can. Enjoy!!!</p>
