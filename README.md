Auto SubDomain Creation

Normally, if we want to create subdomains under root domain (eg: root domain is example.com, we can create many subdomains: blog.example.com, forum.example.com etc.), firstly we have to log into our cPanel account with respective cPanle UserName and Password.

After logging in, we can create subdomains, database and database users.

Here, this script will help us to create subdomains without needing to log into cPanel account.

Easy, Reduce time consuming .. right?

You can create subdomians as much as you can. Enjoy!!!

Running project's screenshots locates the folder "screenshots". Please check them out.

To run the script properly, it needs
real cPanel link, cPanel user name and password.

There is a database table called "users" under the folder called "sql".

Database configuration file is mysqlconnect.php.

URL link is http://localhost:8888/AutoSubdomainCreation/xmlapicalls.php

Notice!

Without providing real cPanl info, the script cannot run. The following steps are required:
- setup database
- insert real cPanel info into xmlapicalls.php

After setting up these two step, you can start create subdomains. 

Then, you can login to Dashboard with the User Name and Password (that you provided in "Create Sub Domain" section) to check the subdomain you created.
Database and Database Username are created automatically by the script behalf of you.

Enjoy!!!!
